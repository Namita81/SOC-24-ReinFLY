# Flappy Bird
This project aims to create an engaging Flappy Bird game using Pygame, where players control a bird navigating through pipes to survive and achieve high scores. The game will feature polished mechanics and appealing visuals, providing smooth gameplay with realistic bird physics and challenging obstacles.

The Pygame environment will be set up, followed by loading graphics and sound assets. Core mechanics will include realistic bird movement, random pipe generation, and accurate collision detection. A scoring system will reward successful navigation, and game-over conditions will be clearly defined. The user interface will display scores and allow seamless game restarts.

Rigorous testing will ensure smooth performance, with bug fixes and improvements based on player feedback. Success will be evaluated through metrics like average score and gameplay duration. This project demonstrates the development of a classic Flappy Bird game, highlighting essential game development skills applicable to other projects.
