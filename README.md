# SOC-24-ReinFLY
This project aims to train an agent to play Flappy Bird using reinforcement learning (RL). I will build a custom Flappy Bird game using Pygame and integrate RL techniques. A reward system will be implemented to guide the agent's learning. Positive actions like passing pipes will be rewarded, while collisions will be penalized. The core part involves training the RL model within the game environment. The agent will learn from its interactions with the game, constantly adjusting its strategies to achieve a higher score and survive longer. Finally, we'll evaluate the trained agent's performance based on metrics like average score and gameplay duration. This project showcases RL's ability to tackle challenging tasks in a game environment. The learnings from this project can potentially be applied to various real-world scenarios beyond games.
